# golangPkgTest

A simple test to see how packages work on golang and how you can set things up.

Seems to be 2 things to packages.
1. Packges are the directory name. Does not matter what the files names are in the packages. It reads all of the files at once. See one.go
2. There does not seem to be a concept of nesting. You have to create sub directories and import them separatly. See threeandfor.go for an example of this.
